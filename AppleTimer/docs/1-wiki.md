### What are sets and repetitions (reps)?
Sets and reps are the terms used to describe the number of times you perform an exercise.
A `rep` is the number of times you perform a specific exercise, and
a `set` is the number of cycles of reps that you complete.

For example, suppose you complete 15 reps of a bench press. You would say you've completed "one set of 15 reps."
A set can be any number of reps, so if you complete 10 reps of a bench press, you would say you've
completed "one set of 10 reps," and if you complete just five reps, then that would be "one set of five reps."

Rep – short for repetition, a rep is a single cycle of lifting and lowering a weight in a controlled manner, moving
    through the form of the exercise.
Set – a set consists of several repetitions performed one after another with no break between them with the number
    of reps per set and sets per exercise depending on the goal of the individual. The number of repetitions one can
    perform at a certain weight is called the Rep Maximum (RM). For example, if one could perform ten reps at 75 lb,
    then that weight would be their 10RM. 1RM is therefore the maximum weight that someone can lift in a given exercise
    — i.e. a weight that they can only lift once without a break.
