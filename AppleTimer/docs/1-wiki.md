### Concepts:
Preset:
- prepare: in Sec
- work: in Sec
- rest: in Sec
- sets-count:
- cycles-divider: in Sec
- cycles count: int,

Preset:
- The user's pre-configuration of a workout timer.

Cycles:
- A cycle includes several sets.

Set: has multiple reps/repetitions;
- A set is a series of repetitions performed sequentially, with rest interval in between. For example, eight repetitions can be one set of bench presses.

Phase:
- There are 3 typical phases: 0.prepare, 1.workout, 3.rest

Reps/Repetition (This's not the word for my purpose);
- A repetition (rep) is one completion of an exercise, such as one deadlift, one bench press, or one arm curl. A repetition maximum (1RM) is your personal best, or the most you can lift once in a single repetition of an exercise. Therefore, a 12RM is the most you can lift and successfully perform 12 repetitions with proper form.

Secs:
- short for seconds.
